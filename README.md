Binary Trees
classic example of a tree is the DOM in the browser or file directories
types
proper binary Tree
complete binary tree
full binary trees
Binary Search Trees
right node value is greater than left node value for all nodes
worst Case if tree is balaced
insertion o(log n)
searching o(log n)
deleting o(log n)
tranversing o(log n)
worst case if tree is skewed(mine skewed to the rigth) not balanced
insertion o(n)
searching o(n)
deleting o(n)
tranversing o(n)
tranversing
inorder
preorder
postorder
levelorder similar to breadth first tranversals in graphs
a tree is an example of a graph
balanced binary search trees
avl trees
red black trees
splay trees
b_trees

trees are used to impleament heaps which is used to implement priority queues though most heads use an array implementation
types of heaps
min heap
max heap




p.s don't try if not comfortable with recursion
